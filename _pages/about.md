I am an applied microeconomist, with an expertise in empirical analyses exploiting large micro data. 
My main research interests lie at the intersection of international trade and urban economics, with a particular focus on the role of trade and technological shocks in the rise of inequalities across regions and different socio-economic groups. I am also interested in the analysis of place-based policies, with a focus on education and crime.
